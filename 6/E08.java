/************E08****************
Exercise 8:   (4) Following the form of the example Lunch.java, create a class called 
ConnectionManager that manages a fixed array of Connection objects. The client 
programmer must not be able to explicitly create Connection objects, but can only get them 
via a static method in ConnectionManager. When the ConnectionManager runs out of 
objects, it returns a null reference. Test the classes in main( ).
